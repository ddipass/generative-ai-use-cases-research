                            Q: What is Amazon Kendra?
                            A: Amazon Kendra is a highly accurate and easy-to-use enterprise search service that uses machine learning (ML). Developers can add search capabilities to their applications. This allows end users to find information stored in vast amounts of content scattered throughout the company. This includes data from manuals, research reports, FAQs, HR-related documents, and customer service guides. It may exist in various systems such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, RDS databases, and Microsoft OneDrive. When a question is input, this service uses machine learning algorithms to understand its content and returns the most appropriate answer, whether it's a direct answer to the question or an entire document. For example, you can ask questions like "What is the cashback rate for corporate credit cards?", and Amazon Kendra will map to relevant documents and return specific answers (such as "2%"). Kendra provides sample code, allowing users to quickly start using and easily integrate highly accurate search into new or existing applications.
                            Q: How does Amazon Kendra integrate with other AWS services?
                            A: Amazon Kendra provides search capabilities using machine learning for all unstructured data that customers store in AWS. Amazon Kendra has easy-to-use native connectors for common AWS repository types such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS databases. You can use other AI services such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Comprehend Medical to preprocess documents, generate searchable text, extract entities, and enrich metadata to achieve even more specialized search capabilities.
                            Q: What types of questions can be asked to Amazon Kendra?
                            A: Amazon Kendra supports the following common types of questions:
                            Factoid questions (who, what, when, where): Such as "Who is Amazon's CEO?" or "When is Prime Day 2022?" These questions require fact-based answers and may be returned in the form of simple phrases. However, the exact answer must be explicitly stated in the ingested text content.
                            Descriptive questions: "How do I connect Echo Plus to the network?" The answer could be a sentence, paragraph, or entire document.
                            Keyword search: Such as "health benefits" or "IT help desk." When the intent and scope are not clear, Amazon Kendra uses deep learning models to return relevant documents.
                            Q: What happens if the exact answer Amazon Kendra is looking for is not included in the data?
                            A: If the exact answer to the question is not included in the data, Amazon Kendra returns a list of the most relevant documents ranked by its deep learning model.
                            Q: What types of questions can't Amazon Kendra answer?
                            A: Amazon Kendra does not yet support questions that require passage aggregation or calculations across documents to answer.
                            Q: How do I get started with Amazon Kendra?
                            A: The Amazon Kendra console provides the easiest way to get started. You can configure Amazon Kendra to point to unstructured and semi-structured documents such as FAQs stored in Amazon S3. After ingestion, you can start testing Kendra by directly entering queries in the [search] section of the console. Then, you can deploy Amazon Kendra search in two easy ways: (1) use the visual UI editor in Experience Builder (no code required), or (2) implement the Amazon Kendra API using a few lines of code for more precise control. Code samples are also available in the console to speed up API implementation.
                            Q: How can I customize Amazon Kendra to better fit my company's specialty or business field?
                            A: Amazon Kendra provides specialized knowledge in fields such as IT, pharmaceuticals, insurance, energy, industry, financial services, law, media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, health, human resources, news, communications, and automotive. By providing your own synonym list, you can further fine-tune or enhance Kendra's understanding of specific fields. Simply upload a specific glossary file, and Amazon Kendra will use those synonyms to improve the quality of user searches.
                            Q: What file types does Amazon Kendra support?
                            A: Amazon Kendra supports unstructured and semi-structured data in .html, MS Office (.doc, .ppt), PDF, and text formats. With the MediaSearch solution, you can also search audio and video files using Amazon Kendra.
                            Q: How does Amazon Kendra handle incremental data updates?
                            A: Amazon Kendra provides two ways to keep the index up to date. First, connectors provide scheduling functionality to automatically synchronize data sources periodically. Second, the Amazon Kendra API allows you to build your own connectors to send data directly from data sources to Amazon Kendra via existing ETL jobs or applications.
                            Q: What languages does Amazon Kendra support?
                            A: For language support, please check the documentation page.
                            Q: What code changes do I need to make to use Amazon Kendra?
                            A: When using native connectors, no coding is required for content ingestion. You can also create your own custom connectors for integration with other data sources using the Amazon Kendra SDK. You can deploy Amazon Kendra search in two easy ways: (1) use the visual UI editor in Experience Builder (no code required), or (2) implement the Kendra API using a few lines of code for greater flexibility. Code samples are also available in the console to speed up API implementation. Using the SDK allows you to fully control and flexibly respond to the end-user experience.
                            Q: In which regions is Amazon Kendra available?
                            A: For details, please see the AWS Services by Region page.
                            Q: Can custom connectors be added?
                            A: You can create your own connectors using the Amazon Kendra custom data source API. Additionally, Amazon Kendra has a partner ecosystem of search experts who can support the construction of connectors that are not currently available from AWS. For details about the partner network, please contact us.
                            Q: How is Amazon Kendra's security handled?
                            A: In Amazon Kendra, data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For data at rest, there are three choices for encryption keys: AWS-owned KMS keys, AWS-managed KMS keys in your account, or customer-managed KMS keys. For data in transit, Amazon Kendra uses the HTTPS protocol for communication with client applications. API calls accessing Amazon Kendra over the network must use Transport Layer Security (TLS) supported by the client.
                            Q: Can Amazon Kendra find answers from audio or video recordings?
